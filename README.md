#Installation 
- Make sure you have the libraries already installed. (I'll add a builder for them later)
- Ensure that you have a Google Services Account and a project with an associated JSON key
- Put that key in the field asking for it

#Running
- Just run the progran. You get ~=4 seconds to exit to a new window and then it'll start inputting commands.
